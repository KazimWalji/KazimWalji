# Hideouts
Worked with a team to develop Hideouts and release it on the App store. Integrated In-App purchases, utilized Firebase Realtime Database so users can chat and accept friend requests, and worked on UI/UX. Setup a backend with node.js that sent specific users notifications when they recieved a chat message or friend request. 

# Robotics
Competed in the First Tech Challenge, and qualified for the World Championship. Won the Illinois State tournament. Programmed an autonomous and driver controlled robot using Java. Incorporated a vision-detection system with OpenCV that differentiated between different objects and my own Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control loops.
