# LinkedIn
Mobile Engineer working on the feed growth team at LinkedIn. Changed how thumbnails of YouTube videos are rendered on LinkedIn's iOS app. Redesigned how reactions are displayed and rendered throughout the platform (search, feed, profile, etc). Changed how 'Follow' buttons are displayed and rendered on feed leading to a cleaner and more consistent codebase.

# Kadama
Developed an iOS app using Swift and UIKit that has over 300,000 users and reached #2 in the App
Store for education. Added important features like pagination on the messages page, a collectionview that suggests
possible responses (similar to Linkedlnâ€™s messaging page), and a picture-in-picture video chat view. Improved back-end processes in Node.js when the app received a large influx of users. Used Google Cloud to catch violent or inappropriate pictures when uploaded into the cloud.

# Robotics
Programmed an autonomous and driver-controlled robot with Java that performed different tasks such as shooting frisbees or stacking blocks. Integrated a PID Control loop in order to ensure a consistent autonomous system. Programmed and engineered a successful robot during that won the State Tournament and qualified
for the World Championship
