# Kadama
Developed an iOS app using Swift and UIKit that has over 300,000 users and reached #2 in the App
Store for education. Added important features like pagination on the messages page, a collectionview that suggests
possible responses (similar to Linkedlnâ€™s messaging page), and a picture-in-picture video chat view. Improved back-end 
processes in Node.js when the app received a large influx of users. Used Google Cloud to catch violent or inappropriate pictures when uploaded into the cloud

# Robotics
Competed in the First Tech Challenge, and qualified for the World Championship. Won the Illinois State tournament. Programmed an autonomous and driver controlled robot using Java. Incorporated a vision-detection system with OpenCV that differentiated between different objects and developed my own Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control loops. I have continued investigating and researching robotics and am currently learning machine learning and AI with PyTorch and Tensorflow. 

# NBA Scores
An app created with Swift and SwiftUI that shows you live NBA Scores. The closest games will be at the top of the list, and the widget will display the closest game along with how much time is left. I really enjoyed creating this iOS app, and am even considering publishing it to the app store. 

# WeTrade
WeTrade is a paper stock trading app where users can buy and sell stock-trading algorithms. The algorithms are written in Python and are run in the cloud using AWS. The app updates live so you can watch each algorithm buy and sell stocks in real time! This is an iOS Development project that blends my passion for software engineering and the stock market. 

# Hideouts
Worked with a team to develop Hideouts and release it on the App store. Integrated In-App purchases, utilized Firebase Realtime Database so users can chat and accept friend requests, and worked on UI/UX. Setup a backend with node.js that sent specific users notifications when they recieved a chat message or friend request.
