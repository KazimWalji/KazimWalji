# Kadama
Developed an iOS app using Swift and UIKit that has over 300,000 users and reached #2 in the App
Store for education. Added important features like pagination on the messages page, a collectionview that suggests
possible responses (similar to Linkedln’s messaging page), and a picture-in-picture video chat view. Improved back-end processes in Node.js when the app received a large influx of users. Used Google Cloud to catch violent or inappropriate pictures when uploaded into the cloud.

# Robotics
Programmed an autonomous and driver-controlled robot with Java that performed different tasks such as shooting frisbees or stacking blocks.
Integrated a PID Control loop in order to ensure a consistent autonomous system. 
Programmed and engineered a successful robot during that won the State Tournament and qualified/
for the World Championship

# WeTrade
Built an open-source iOS app that allowed users to buy and sell stock trading algorithms using
Alpaca’s REST API. 
Users can see the algorithms trading and their portfolio growing in realtime. Algorithms were written in Python and hosted on AWS while the app was built in Swift.

# Hideouts
Developed an iOS social media app with Swift, UIKit, and Firebase for a startup. Wrote and deployed Firebase Cloud Functions written in Node.js that sends notifications to users when they receive a new message or friend request in the app.
