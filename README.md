Senior in highschool, currently a Junior IOS Developer at Hideouts. I am especially interested in App Development and Robotics. https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazim-walji-2477111b4/

# Hideouts
Worked with a team to develop Hideouts and release it on the App store. Integrated In-App purchases, utilized Firebase Realtime Database so users can chat and accept friend requests, worked on UI/UX, and learned how to integrate Stripe payments with Node.js.

# Robotics
Competed in the First Tech Challenge, and qualified for the World Championship. Won the Illinois State tournament. Programmed an autonomous and driver controlled robot using Java. Incorporated a vision-detection system with OpenCV that differentiated between different objects and my own Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control loops.
