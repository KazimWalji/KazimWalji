# Kadama
Developing an app that has over 300K downloads and has been ranked #2 on the App Store for education. Improved the UI/UX design and improved the secuirty of the backend database. Added features like an improved chat system where users can save pre-typed messages and send them when they wish, similar to LinkedIn's messaging feature. 

# Robotics
Competed in the First Tech Challenge, and qualified for the World Championship. Won the Illinois State tournament. Programmed an autonomous and driver controlled robot using Java. Incorporated a vision-detection system with OpenCV that differentiated between different objects and developed my own Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control loops. I have continued investigating and researching robotics and am currently learning machine learning and AI with PyTorch and Tensorflow. 

# WeTrade
WeTrade is a paper stock trading app where users can buy and sell stock-trading algorithms. The algorithms are written in Python and are run in the cloud using AWS. The app updates live so you can watch each algorithm buy and sell stocks in real time! This is an iOS Development project that blends my passion for software engineering and the stock market. 

# Hideouts
Worked with a team to develop Hideouts and release it on the App store. Integrated In-App purchases, utilized Firebase Realtime Database so users can chat and accept friend requests, and worked on UI/UX. Setup a backend with node.js that sent specific users notifications when they recieved a chat message or friend request.
