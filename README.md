# Amazon
Software Engineer on Prime Reading team

# LinkedIn
Worked as an iOS Engineer Intern on the Home feed team using Objective-C and Swift. Increased consistency in the codebase by building reusable follow buttons and reaction icons that are referenced across the app in feed, profile, and search. Exceeded expectations by launching four major changes to LinkedIn’s iOS app, such as changing how external videos are presented on feed and by adding cards on Feed that suggests companies and people users can follow

# Kadama
Developed an iOS app using Swift and UIKit that has over 300,000 users and reached #2 in the App
Store for education. Added important features like pagination on the messages page, a collectionview that suggests
possible responses (similar to Linkedln’s messaging page), and a picture-in-picture video chat view. Improved back-end processes in Node.js when the app received a large influx of users. Used Google Cloud to catch violent or inappropriate pictures when uploaded into the cloud.

# Robotics
Programmed an autonomous and driver-controlled robot with Java that performed different tasks such as shooting frisbees or stacking blocks. Integrated a PID Control loop in order to ensure a consistent autonomous system. Programmed and engineered a successful robot during that won the State Tournament and qualified
for the World Championship
